<h1>Brain Tumor Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This project aims to detect brain tumors from medical images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The CNN model is trained on a dataset consisting of brain MRI images labeled as either containing a tumor or not. The trained model is then used to predict tumor presence in unseen MRI images.</p>

<h2>Project Structure</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Code:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>The code is written in Python using the Keras library with TensorFlow backend for building and training the CNN model.</li>
            <li>It includes scripts for data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and prediction.</li>
            <li>Key components such as data loading, model architecture definition, training, and evaluation are documented within the code.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Data:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>The dataset consists of brain MRI images stored in folders labeled 'yes' and 'no', representing images with and without tumors, respectively.</li>
            <li>Additionally, there is a folder 'pred' containing MRI images for prediction.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Usage:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>To use the project:
                <ol>
                    <li>Place the MRI images in appropriate folders ('yes' for tumor images, 'no' for non-tumor images, and 'pred' for prediction images).</li>
                    <li>Run the provided Python script to preprocess the data, build and train the CNN model, and evaluate its performance.</li>
                    <li>After training, use the model to predict tumor presence in new MRI images.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Results:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>After training, the model's performance metrics such as accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix are evaluated.</li>
            <li>Predictions on new MRI images are made using the trained model, and the results are displayed.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Model Architecture</h2>

<p>The CNN model architecture consists of several convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers, batch normalization, dropout, and dense layers for classification. The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function.</p>

<h2>Evaluation</h2>

<p>The model is evaluated on a separate test dataset to assess its performance. Metrics such as accuracy, loss, precision, recall, and F1-score are computed to evaluate the model's effectiveness in tumor detection.</p>

<h2>Dependencies</h2>

<p>The project requires the following dependencies:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Python 3.x</li>
    <li>Keras with TensorFlow backend</li>
    <li>NumPy</li>
    <li>pandas</li>
    <li>Matplotlib</li>
    <li>scikit-learn</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>
